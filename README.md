## Overview
This modpack was designed specifically for the *SpicedVanilla* server in order to create a more immersive survival experience while maintaining the integrity and aesthetic of **true Vanilla Minecraft**. This means all mods in this pack are meant to **augment** survival, rather than add in complex and memory-heavy mods that take away from the charm of Vanilla gameplay.
